Good morning ${attendee.first},

We are excited to inform you that we have worked diligently to resolve past registration issues including wi-fi outages, which caused delays and required the completion of additional forms.

With the new DIGITAL FAST PASS, you will be able to enter the show quickly by using the fast lane.

We will have your physical RIVER CAR CLUB BADGE ready at our next show on June 10th for easy entry in the future.
